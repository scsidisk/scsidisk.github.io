This is a quick introduction to installing R on OS X Mountain Lion.

But first, what is R?

R is a system for statistical computation and graphics. It provides, among other things, a programming language, high level graphics, interfaces to other languages and debugging facilities.

### 1. Installation

You can download a package for OS X, or go with Homebrew â€“ my route. For the Mountain Lion, youâ€™ll need to install XQuartz and a Fortran compiler first.

Install XQuartz. Download it from here.

Install Fortran & R:

```bash
# updated 30 Sept 2013
$ brew update
$ brew tap homebrew/science
$ brew install gfortran r
```

Homebrew should be done compiling and installing within 10 minutes.

### 2. Test

To test the installation, run r in terminal, you should get something like this:

```
dvdsmpsn-mac:~ david$ r

R version 3.0.1 (2013-05-16) -- "Good Sport"

  Natural language support but running in an English locale

R is a collaborative project with many contributors.
Type 'contributors()' for more information and
'citation()' on how to cite R or R packages in publications.

Type 'demo()' for some demos, 'help()' for on-line help, or
'help.start()' for an HTML browser interface to help.
Type 'q()' to quit R.

```

You can then start some baby steps such as basic addition and creating functions

```r
> x <- 4+5
> x
[1] 9
>
> addup <- function(a, b=10)
+ {
+     return (a+b)
+ }
> addup(4,5)
[1] 9
```

When youâ€™re done, quit the R console:

```r
> q()
```
